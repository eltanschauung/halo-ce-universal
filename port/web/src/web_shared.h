WEB_SHARED.H

The words of the game's memory the page reads and writes itself
(port/web/site/app.js, touch.js): the WebAssembly memory is shared, so the
page's thread sees them as the game's threads do, without a message. The
page finds them with web_state (web_main.c) and knows them by these indices,
32-bit words each: change them together.
